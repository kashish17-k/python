'''Take a list, say for example this one:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the
list that are less than 5.
Extras:
a) Instead of printing the elements one by one,
make a new list that has all the elements less
than 5 from this list in it and print out this new
list.
b) Write this in one line of Python.
c) Ask the user for a number and return a list that
contains only elements from the original list a
that are smaller than that number given by the
user.'''
